🔍 COMPREHENSIVE SCORING LOGIC FIX
===================================

✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

1. FRONTEND ISSUE: 
   - CameraAssessment calls onComplete(false, successCount) on timeout
   - AssessmentPage was setting completed=true even when success=false
   - This caused backend to see "attempted but not successful" as "completed"

2. BACKEND LOGIC:
   - Physical: score = 1 only if (completed=true AND success_count >= 5)
   - Linguistic: score = 1 only if (completed=true AND success_count >= 1)

3. THE FIX:
   - Frontend now sets completed=true ONLY when score > 0 (actually successful)
   - This ensures frontend and backend calculations are identical

📋 NEW FLOW:

SCENARIO 1: Physical Task - User raises hands 3 times, then timeout
- CameraAssessment: onComplete(false, 3) 
- AssessmentPage: physicalScore = (false && 3 >= 5) ? 1 : 0 = 0
- TaskDetails: completed = (0 > 0) = false
- Backend: score = (false && 3 >= 5) ? 1 : 0 = 0 ✅

SCENARIO 2: Physical Task - User raises hands 7 times successfully  
- CameraAssessment: onComplete(true, 7)
- AssessmentPage: physicalScore = (true && 7 >= 5) ? 1 : 0 = 1
- TaskDetails: completed = (1 > 0) = true  
- Backend: score = (true && 7 >= 5) ? 1 : 0 = 1 ✅

SCENARIO 3: Linguistic Task - User says "mama" once
- VoiceAssessment: onComplete(true, transcript, 1)
- AssessmentPage: linguisticScore = (true && 1 >= 1) ? 1 : 0 = 1
- TaskDetails: completed = (1 > 0) = true
- Backend: score = (true && 1 >= 1) ? 1 : 0 = 1 ✅

🎯 RESULT:
✅ Frontend summary score = Backend database score
✅ Assessment page score = Results page score  
✅ No more discrepancies anywhere in the system
✅ Marks only given for ACTUAL AI-detected success
