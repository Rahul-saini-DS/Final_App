print("=" * 50)

print("\n❌ PREVIOUS ISSUE:")
print("• Assessment Page showed: 6/6 (using frontend scores.physical & scores.linguistic)")
print("• Results Page showed: 4/6 (using backend-calculated scores)")
print("• This created inconsistency and confusion!")

print("\n✅ FIXES APPLIED:")
print("1. Assessment Page Summary:")
print("   - Physical score: uses (taskStates.physical.successCount > 0) ? 1 : 0")
print("   - Linguistic score: uses (taskStates.linguistic.successCount > 0) ? 1 : 0")
print("   - Total: intelligence + (physical success) + (linguistic success)")

print("\n2. API Submission:")
print("   - Calculates physicalScore = taskStates.physical.successCount > 0 ? 1 : 0")
print("   - Calculates linguisticScore = taskStates.linguistic.successCount > 0 ? 1 : 0")
print("   - Sends calculated scores to backend (not frontend state scores)")

print("\n3. Results Page:")
print("   - Receives correct calculated scores from frontend")
print("   - Shows same values as assessment summary")

print("\n🎯 RESULT:")
print("✅ Assessment Page, Results Page, and Database now all show SAME scores!")
print("✅ Scoring rule: Physical/Linguistic = 1 ONLY if actual AI success detected")
print("✅ No more 6/6 vs 4/6 discrepancy!")

print("\n📊 EXAMPLE SCENARIO:")
print("- Intelligence: 4/4 correct answers = 4 points")
print("- Physical: Attempted but AI detected 0 successes = 0 points")  
print("- Linguistic: Attempted but AI detected 0 successes = 0 points")
print("- TOTAL: 4/6 (shown consistently everywhere)")

print("\n" + "=" * 50)
print("🎉 FRONTEND SCORING LOGIC NOW FIXED!")
