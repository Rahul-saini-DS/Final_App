ðŸŽ¯ FINAL AI DETECTION SCORING LOGIC - FIXED!
===================================================

âœ… PROBLEM SOLVED: Now marks are given ONLY when AI actually detects success!

ðŸ“Š SCORING RULES:

1. PHYSICAL TASKS:
   - Instruction: "Raise your hands above your head"
   - AI Detection: Must detect raised hands 5 times
   - Score = 1 ONLY if AI successfully detects pose â‰¥5 times
   - Score = 0 if AI detects pose <5 times (partial success doesn't count)

2. LINGUISTIC TASKS:  
   - Instruction: "Say 'mama'"
   - AI Detection: Must hear target word in speech transcript
   - Score = 1 ONLY if AI hears target word â‰¥1 time
   - Score = 0 if AI doesn't hear target word (just making sound doesn't count)

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Backend Scoring Logic:
- Physical: score = 1 if (completed=True AND success_count >= 5) else 0
- Linguistic: score = 1 if (completed=True AND success_count >= 1) else 0

Frontend Display Logic:
- Physical: shows 1/1 âœ… only if taskStates.physical.successCount >= 5
- Linguistic: shows 1/1 âœ… only if taskStates.linguistic.successCount >= 1
- Total Score: intelligence + (physical success) + (linguistic success)

ðŸŽ‰ RESULT:
âœ… No more marks for just "attempting" tasks
âœ… Marks only given when AI actually detects what user is supposed to do
âœ… Frontend and backend scoring now perfectly aligned
âœ… Consistent scoring across all pages and database

Example Scenario:
- User tries to raise hands but AI only detects 3/5 times â†’ Physical Score: 0/1
- User says "mama" but AI hears "ma ma ma" â†’ Linguistic Score: 1/1 (target heard)
- Intelligence: 2/4 correct â†’ Intelligence Score: 2/4
- TOTAL: 3/6 (shown consistently everywhere!)
