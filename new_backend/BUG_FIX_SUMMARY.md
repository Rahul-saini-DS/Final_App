## BUG FIX SUMMARY: Physical Score Showing 0 Instead of 1

### Problem
The frontend was showing Physical score as 0 even when the task was completed successfully and the database stored the correct score as 1.

### Root Cause
**Incorrect column indices in the `/api/child-responses/<int:child_id>` route** in `app.py`.

The code was using wrong indices when accessing the `ai_task_responses` database columns:

```python
# WRONG (before fix):
task_type = resp[4]           # Should be resp[3]
original_success = resp[6]    # Should be resp[5] 
completion_time = resp[8]     # Should be resp[7]
ai_feedback = resp[10]        # Should be resp[9]
```

### Database Schema
The `ai_task_responses` table has the following structure:
- Index 0: ai_response_id
- Index 1: result_id  
- Index 2: child_id
- Index 3: **task_type** ← Was using index 4
- Index 4: task_name
- Index 5: **success_count** ← Was using index 6  
- Index 6: total_attempts
- Index 7: **completion_time_seconds** ← Was using index 8
- Index 8: success_rate
- Index 9: **ai_feedback** ← Was using index 10
- Index 10: was_completed ✓ (correct)
- Index 11: was_skipped ✓ (correct)
- Index 12: created_at

### The Fix
Corrected the column indices in two files:

**1. `app.py` lines ~1269-1299:**
```python
# FIXED:
task_type = resp[3]        # task_type (correct index)
original_success = resp[5]  # success_count (correct index)
completion_time = resp[7]   # completion_time_seconds (correct)
ai_feedback = resp[9]       # ai_feedback (correct)
```

**2. `simulate_api.py` lines ~38-42:**
```python  
# FIXED:
task_type = resp[3]         # task_type column (corrected)
original_success = resp[5]  # success_count column (corrected)  
was_skipped = resp[11]      # was_skipped column (corrected)
was_completed = resp[10]    # was_completed column (corrected)
```

### Test Results
✅ **Before fix**: API calculated physical_binary = 0 (wrong `success_count` value)
✅ **After fix**: API calculated physical_binary = 1 (correct `success_count = 5`)
✅ **Database consistency**: Stored physical_score = 1 matches calculated score = 1

### Impact
- Physical assessments that were completed successfully now show the correct score of 1 instead of 0
- Total scores are now calculated correctly  
- Frontend displays accurate assessment results
- Historical data integrity maintained (database was always correct)

The issue was purely in the API data retrieval layer, not in the scoring logic or database storage.
