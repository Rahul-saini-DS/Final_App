ðŸ”§ REAL FIX APPLIED TO ACTUAL FILES
==================================

âœ… FIXED ResultsPage.tsx:
- Line 28-29: Changed from detailedScoring?.physical?.success_count to scores.physical
- Line 33-34: Changed from detailedScoring?.linguistic?.success_count to scores.linguistic  
- Added debugging console.log to see what data is received

âœ… FIXED AssessmentPage.tsx:
- Added debugging console.log to see what data is sent

ðŸŽ¯ THE REAL ISSUE WAS:
ResultsPage was trying to get physical/linguistic scores from detailedScoring object,
but AssessmentPage was sending them in the scores object.

ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS:
1. Take a new assessment
2. Check browser console to see the debug logs
3. Verify scores match across summary and results pages

The fix ensures ResultsPage uses scores.physical and scores.linguistic directly
from what AssessmentPage calculated and sent.
