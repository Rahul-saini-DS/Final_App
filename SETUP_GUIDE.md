# 🎯 Quick Setup Guide - Born Genius Assessment App

## ✅ What I've Fixed For You

I've successfully replicated your Streamlit app functionality into a proper frontend-backend architecture:

### 🎨 Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **StreamlitAssessmentPage**: Exact replica of your Streamlit app
- User info form with child and parent details
- Physical tasks with webcam integration
- Linguistic tasks with microphone functionality  
- Intelligence questions with progress tracking
- Beautiful gradient UI matching your Streamlit styling

### 🔧 Backend (Flask + SQLAlchemy)
- Complete API for all assessment functionality
- Database models for users, children, assessments
- All intelligence questions replicated by age group
- Physical and linguistic task configurations
- Proper authentication and session management

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   double-click start_app.bat
   
   # On Mac/Linux:
   chmod +x start_app.sh
   ./start_app.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup:
```bash
cd backend
pip install flask flask-cors sqlalchemy python-dotenv passlib PyJWT python-jose
python init_db.py
python app.py
```

#### Frontend Setup:
```bash
cd Frontend  
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Access the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **API Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Go to http://localhost:5173**
2. **Sign up** with a new account or **Login**
3. **Choose "Interactive Assessment"** (this is your Streamlit replica)
4. **Fill in user information** (child details, parent info)
5. **Select age group** (0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6)
6. **Complete the three tasks**:
   - 🏃 **Physical Task**: Movement challenges with webcam
   - 🗣️ **Linguistic Task**: Speech tasks with microphone
   - 🧩 **Intelligence Questions**: Age-appropriate cognitive questions
7. **View results** with detailed scoring

## 🎯 Key Features Replicated

### ✅ From Your Streamlit App:
- Exact same user interface design
- All age groups (0-1 through 5-6 years)
- Physical tasks for each age group
- Linguistic tasks with target words
- Intelligence questions by category
- Progress tracking and scoring
- Beautiful gradient backgrounds
- Task badges and emojis
- Timer functionality
- Success/failure feedback

### ✅ Additional Improvements:
- Multi-user support with authentication
- Database persistence of all assessments
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- RESTful API architecture
- Session management
- Assessment history tracking
- Better error handling

## 🔧 Database

The app uses **SQLite** by default for easy setup. Your database file will be created as `backend/born_genius_dev.db`.

To switch to PostgreSQL (for production):
1. Update the `POSTGRESQL_URL` in `backend/.env`
2. Install PostgreSQL locally
3. Create a database named `born_genius`

## 📱 Mobile Support

The application works perfectly on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones
- Any device with a web browser

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend build errors:
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
```

### Database errors:
```bash
cd backend
python init_db.py
```

### Port conflicts:
- Backend uses port 5000
- Frontend uses port 5173
- Make sure these ports are available

## 🎉 Success!

Your Streamlit app has been successfully converted to a production-ready web application! 

The `/streamlit-assessment` route provides exactly the same user experience as your original Streamlit app, but with:
- Better performance
- Multi-user support
- Database persistence
- Mobile compatibility
- Scalable architecture

## 📊 Assessment Flow

1. **User Info Collection** → 2. **Physical Task** → 3. **Linguistic Task** → 4. **Intelligence Questions** → 5. **Results Page**

Each step matches your original Streamlit implementation with the same scoring system and age-appropriate content.
